*Datasets links:*
 * [IMDb] (http://www.imdb.com/interfaces) / [IMDbPY] (http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/index.html)
 * [White House] (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/disclosures/visitor-records)
 * [Last.fm] (http://www.last.fm/api) (only an API)

* For the musicians that went to the WH, how many have already acted on cinema?
* What musicians have acted and worked on the soundtrack for the same movie?
* Look for musicians/actors from a same movie that went to WH and the movie has or is about the WH.
