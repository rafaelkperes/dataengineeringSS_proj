#Pull before working. Avoid merges. :)

Once cloned, **create dir "datasets"** and put every dataset in there.

Just a tiny tip for
[**Understanding the GitHub Flow**](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), read it if you don't know :)
> make the master branch always deployable. Unless you're confidential, development work should be commited to other branches. Then **pull request** --> **team review** --> **merge** to master
