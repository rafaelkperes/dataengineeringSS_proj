# soundtruck list

I used [open refine](http://openrefine.org/) to parse the raw txt data.

In this fold there are two files and one subfolder:
- `soundtrack-list.txt` is in json format of after parsing data, each cell has **musician name**, **corresponding film** and **the production year of the film**. 
 
- the subfolder is `open refine project file`. To use it, put it in the 'AppData/refine' diretory ([how to find the diretory](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Back-Up-OpenRefine-Data)). In case you want to make further edition.
