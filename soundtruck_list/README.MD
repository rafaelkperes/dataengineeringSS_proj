# soundtruck list

I used [open refine](http://openrefine.org/) to parse the raw txt data.

In this fold there are two files, one is `json file` of after parsing data, each cell has **musician name**, **corresponding film** and **the production year of the film**. Another one is `open refine project file`. In case you want to make further edition.
